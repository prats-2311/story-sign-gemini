To ensure we are aligned before diving into architectural patterns, here is a summary of the purpose and functionality for each of the three modules within the **StorySign** platform:

### 1. StorySign ASL World

* 
**Purpose:** This is the core educational module designed to teach American Sign Language (ASL) to children.


* 
**Functionality:** It uses interactive, dynamically generated stories to make learning engaging. The user journey typically involves the child showing an object to the camera, which triggers the generation of a story they then practice signing sentence-by-sentence. The AI provides holistic feedback on their hand shape, motion, and body language.



### 2. StorySign Harmony

* 
**Purpose:** This module serves as a Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) tutor, primarily for neurodivergent children or anyone looking to improve their understanding of social cues.


* 
**Functionality:** It provides a safe, non-judgmental "Simon Says" style game where the app displays a target emotion (e.g., "Surprise" or "Happy") and the user attempts to mirror that expression. The system analyzes facial landmarks to provide real-time visual cues and enthusiastic feedback to help the user recognize and replicate micro-expressions.



### 3. StorySign Reconnect

* 
**Purpose:** This is the therapeutic module intended as a digital companion for patients recovering from strokes, brain injuries, or managing motor neuron diseases like Parkinson’s.


* 
**Functionality:** It provides a structured and measurable environment for performing daily physical therapy exercises for the hands and face. Unlike a simple mirror, it calculates quantitative data such as joint angles (to measure a fist clench), facial symmetry, and movement smoothness to track rehabilitation progress over time.



These modules are unified by a "compassionate digital mirror" philosophy, using AI to turn physical movement into data-driven, encouraging feedback.
